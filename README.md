# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to aid in the production and manufacturing process of the MechaCar prototype. For this analysis our ways to interpret the data will mainly be:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![linear_regression](https://github.com/carloshgalvan95/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/linear_regression.png)

To first evaluate the data we have, we will perform linear regression on out dataset that contains information points on the prototypes, our target variable to predict will be MPG, the metrics we have are:

- Vehicle Lenght
- Vehicle Weight
- Spoiler Angle
- Ground Clearance
- AWD
- Miles per Gallon

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition




- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
